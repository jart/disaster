;; Disaster lets you press `C-c d` to see the compiled assembly code for the
;; C, C++ or Fortran file you're currently editing. It even jumps to and
;; highlights the line of assembly corresponding to the line beneath your cursor.
;;
;; It works by creating a `.o` file using `make` (if you have a Makefile), or
;; `cmake` (if you have a `compile_commands.json` file) or the default system
;; compiler. It then runs that file through `objdump` to generate the
;; human-readable assembly.

;;; Installation:

;; Make sure to place `disaster.el` somewhere in the `load-path`, then you should
;; be able to run `M-x disaster`. If you want, you add the following lines to
;; your `.emacs` file to register the `C-c d` shortcut for invoking `disaster`:
;;
;; ```elisp
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/PATH/TO/DISASTER")
;; (require 'disaster)
;; (define-key c-mode-map (kbd "C-c d") 'disaster)
;; (define-key fortran-mode-map (kbd "C-c d") 'disaster)
;; ```

;; #### Doom Emacs

;; For Doom Emacs users, you can add this snippet to your `packages.el`.
;;
;; ```elisp
;; (package! disaster
;;   :recipe (:host github :repo "jart/disaster"))
;; ```
;;
;; And this to your `config.el`:
;;
;; ```elisp
;; (use-package! disaster
;;   :commands (disaster)
;;   :init
;;   ;; If you prefer viewing assembly code in `nasm-mode` instead of `asm-mode`
;;   (setq disaster-assembly-mode 'nasm-mode)
;;
;;   (map! :localleader
;;         :map (c++-mode-map c-mode-map fortran-mode-map)
;;         :desc "Disaster" "d" #'disaster))
